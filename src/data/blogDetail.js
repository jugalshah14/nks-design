      title: "Understand your risk tolerance profile",
      text: "Each person has a different risk tolerance level depending on their age, financial condition and goals, priorities, profession, etc., and you need to define which category you belong to. A conservative investor does not take many risks with her/his money and will be happy with a relatively lower rate of return as long as it is regular and fixed. On the other hand, an aggressive investor takes higher risks to earn a higher rate of return on the investment. A moderate investor sits between these two extremes. You must build your portfolio of investments that fit your profile so that your goals can be achieved with minimum effort.",
